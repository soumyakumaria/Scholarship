# Scholarship
Scholarships are awarded to support a student's education. Every scholarship has a different set of requirements. There are so many scholarships available, it is hard to track all of them and also determine which scholarships a student can apply for. A system is created to ensure all the information regarding scholarship application, deadline, document requirement, grade requirement, student status requirement is readily available. Students are able to search for all the scholarships that they can apply quickly. 
A software that awards scholarships to university students is created. There are different kinds of scholarships available for students dependent on the level of study - undergraduate, graduate, master, post-graduate, PhD. The software can filter the scholarships a student can apply for according to his/her  level of study, grades and courses finished.  The software is GUI based. A student is able to access the scholarship GUI using his/her institutionâ€™s email address and password.
